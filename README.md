##Epicodus bootcamp exercise Rails 4
###Brentwood Reid and Patti Jurgensen

This is an app that lets users upload their photos to share with the world.

* Start off by letting people create accounts, following along with the authentication Railscast.

* Then, let them upload photos.

* Next, allow them to tag other users in photos. To keep this simple, just display a list of all the users in a drop-down menu when you add a tag to a photo.
